If you're playing this, it's too late.

For my project, I created a Choose Your Own Adventure style game. I wanted to cement the basics that we've been learning over the past few weeks, so I chose something that would incorporate (at least what I felt), a general understanding of logic. Throughout the course of this project, I believe that my grasp on understanding logic, and breaking down what I want to into more basic terms has been strengthened. 

Generally speaking, a CYOA game is a series of if-else events. If you choose this, go here, else if this is chosen, go there, or else, do this. Therefore, the majority of my game is events that had to be written out, a click counter to determine what step you're at, and a function that would decide what event to be assigned at each fork. 

Some difficulties I ran into during this process were trying to focus on individual elements to work on. I got really sidetracked multiple times throughout, and spent time on searching for things that might not have necessarily been useful.

I do have plans for the game going forward, I need to add items that present the user situations wherein they might be required to survive, I'd like to clean it up a bit, so that the html/css looks better when displayed. As well as adding in some stylistic things; i.e. modals that would popup and alert you to who you're speaking with, and ideally, I'd like to add in a 2player mode, where both players work together to survive. (my idea for this would be that you'd have to choose items that get assigned to each player, and at certain points the right player would have to use the item in order to advance.) 

All in all, I'm proud of what I've done with this project, and I'm looking forward to being able to improve upon it.
